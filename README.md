Set up the file structure

- Focus on data cleaning
    - install dependencies
    - setting remote repo, is different from setting a local repo
    - check if ther are na values
    - check for duplicate records
    - change column names to more readable stuff

    Cleaning typically involes 
    - Removing or imputing missing values.
    - Dropping irrelevant columns.
    - Handling outliers.
    - Encoding categorical variables.
    
    - Insights
        - We realized that no single column in our dataset has any null values. 
            - It means that our dataset was a clean dataset or the missing values were already taken care of.
        - Then, we saw our dataset did not have any duplicate values.
        - Then we renamed some columns and changed their positions for convenience.

    - loaded the cleaned data into the processed data folder
